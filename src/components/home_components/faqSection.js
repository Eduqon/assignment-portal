                Assessment is essential to the learning procedures. According to
                John Biggs, an expert on higher education, "What and how
                students learn depends to a great extent on how they perceive
                they will be graded." Given the significance of assessment for
                student learning, it is critical to think carefully about the
                most effective method for measuring the learning you want your
                students to acquire. Assessments should incorporate learning,
                grading, and student enthusiasm. Effective evaluation methods
                provide crucial insights into students' learning. They outline
                the subjects the students studied, how well they retained the
                content, and the difficulties they encountered.

                Your assignment's introduction is the first paragraph. Your
                introduction should inform the reader about the paper's topic
                and the justifications you plan to make for it. The aim of your
                paper is made clear to the reader by the{" "}

                , which is part of the introduction. By shifting from a generic
                to a specific introduction, you can accomplish these. The first
                stage should consist of general summary of the subject of your
                project. The topic should be focused in the center of the
                introduction so that your reader can see how it relates to your
                paper's overall goal. Finally, make sure to properly state your
                thesis before leading the reader to your major point.
